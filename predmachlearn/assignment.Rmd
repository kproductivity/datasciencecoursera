##Synopsis
A machine learning algorithm is devised to predict activity quality from activity monitors. It is described what the out of sample error is and an estimate of the error is given from a cross-validation exercise.

##Data and exploratory analysis

The dataset has 5 classes (sitting-down, standing-up, standing, walking, and sitting) collected on 8 hours of activities of 4 healthy subjects. The authors also established a baseline performance index.

```{r}
library(caret)
library(rattle)
library(rpart.plot)

train.df <- read.csv("pml-training.csv", na.strings = "NA")
test.df <- read.csv("pml-testing.csv", na.strings = "NA")

# Train data is splitted for cross-validation purposes

set.seed(123)

inTrain <- createDataPartition(y = train.df$classe, p = 0.75, list = FALSE)
train <- train.df[inTrain, ]
test <- train.df[-inTrain, ]

```


##Algorithm

A prediction tree has been selected.

```{r}

fit <- train(classe~., data = train, method = "rpart", tuneLength = 30)
printcp(fit)

fancyRpartPlot(fit$finalModel)

predict(fit, newdata = test)
confusionMatrix(predict(fit, newdata = test), test$classe)
```
