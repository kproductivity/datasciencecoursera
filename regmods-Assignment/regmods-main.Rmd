# Executive Summary


# Dataset and Exploratory Analysis
The analysed dataset is the `mtcars` data from the `datasets` package. It contains information on 11 variables for 32 observations from Motor Trend Car Road Tests.

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(datasets)
str(mtcars)
```

The variables are correlated in the following manner:

```{r echo = FALSE}
library(corrgram)
corrgram(mtcars, order = TRUE,
         lower.panel = panel.shade,
         upper.panel = panel.pts,
         text.panel = panel.txt)
```

As we can see, all five numerical variables seem to have either an indirect relationship with the miles per gallon (i.e. disp, hp, wt) or a direct one (i.e. drat, qsec).


# Analysis

```{r}
fit <- lm(mtcars$mpg .)
